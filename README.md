# docker-in-practice
This is a demo project where I used Docker to set up a full-stack environment. It has a Node.js backend, a MongoDB database, and a Mongo Express admin GUI, all running together using Docker Compose. The goal was to showcase how containerization can make developing and running a complete application easier and more consistent.
